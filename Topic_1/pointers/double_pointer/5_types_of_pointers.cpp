/*

types of pointers 

1) null --> it means pointer is pointing nothing , if we don't have any value to assign we can use null
2) void pointer  -->  void *ptr == > A void pointer can hold an address of any type and can be typecasted to any type. Thus we can use the void pointer to store the address of any variable.

note--  void pointers cannot be dereferenced. 

3) Wild pointer -->  A pointer behaves like a wild pointer when declared but not initialized. So, they point to any random memory location.

4) Dangling Pointers:


A dangling pointer is a pointer pointing to a memory location that has been freed (or deleted). There are three different ways where Pointer acts as a dangling pointer.
