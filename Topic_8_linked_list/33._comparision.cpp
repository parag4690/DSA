// space , insert , delete , insert 

// compare between single , circular , double , double circular 

// double take double space then single as it use two pointer for traversing

// insert =>  diffrernce is only insert before first , single = O(1)-modify 2links , circular = O(n) as we have to do to end , double = O(1) , circular double = O(1)

// delete => single = O(1) , cicular = O(n) , double = O(1) , circular = O(1);

// comparision linked vs array

// linked list takes more space than array as it have to take extra space for store pointer(address of next one)
// array can be access easily  a[3] - faster , but linked we have to travese in sequence


// insert -> min = O(1) to O(n); shift the indexins , on right hand side array is faster but, , there is shifting of data and it is costly cause one can take 4 bytes and another one can take 8 bytes

// insert in linked list = >  O(1) -> O(n) due to moving of pointer  , o left had side list is faster , there is no shiftng of data
// binery seach can possible in linked list but  , becouse it will take O(nlongn) more time;, in array we can go easily , 

// sort is also suitable for both

// so which is better , depend on situtions;
